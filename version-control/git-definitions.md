# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revision made by different people. It is really useful because it protects software - if someone makes a mistake you can always look at the history.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Creating a branch in Git gives you a copy of your project to work on. If you want to update your project in any way, you would use a branch - branching is a way of keeping all experiments outside of the original working project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A Git commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
Before you can commit, you must merge your ready files back into the original project to test that everything will run smoothly. A merge conflict is when it does not run smoothly and you have to figure out why it's not working.
