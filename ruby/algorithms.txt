Algorithm For Using an Elevator
- first the robot needs to figure out what floor it's going to
- if there is only one button outside the elevator it should be pressed
- otherwise if there are two buttons 
    - if the floor the robot needs to go to is higher than the floor it is on then the robot needs to press the top button 
    - or if the floor it's going to is lower than the number of the floor it is on then it should press the bottom button
    - otherwise it is on the right floor already
- once the doors open the robot should move forward until it is in the middle of the elevator 
- the robot should turn right until it's facing the button panel
- the robot should move forward until the button panel is reached
- the robot should move its button pusher up and to the left until it is at the very top left button
- until the button with the matching floor number is found:
    - move button pusher to the right by one button
    - if no button is left on that row then go down one button 
    -move button pusher to the left by one button
    - if no button is left on that row then move down a button
- when the number on the button matches the floor destination, press the button          

Algorithm For Brushing Teeth
- unscrew cap from toothpaste
- hold toothpaste in left hand and hold tooth brush in right hand 
- bring left hand holding toothpaste to the head of the tooth brush and squeeze toothpaste across the brush.
- put toothpaste down
- bring brush to mouth and move it to the bottom back right tooth
- until brush is at the bottom back left tooth
    - move brush back and forth while slowly moving to the left one tooth at a time
- turn brush so it is pointing up and is against the top back left tooth
- until brush is at the top back right tooth
    - move brush back and forth while slowly moving to the right one tooth at a time
- move brush to the middle of the mouth and point brush down against tongue
- brush back and fourth long tongue 6 times
- remove brush from mouth and rinse it in water
- put toothbrush down
- spit toothpaste into sink 
- cup hands together and bring water to mouth to rinse it
